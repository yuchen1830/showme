# Example 1: Learning Plan Creation
# instruction = """I want to learn more about Sourdough Bread Making. It's my first time learning about it, and want to get a good grasp by investing 1 hour a day for the next 2 months. Go find online courses/resources, create a plan cross-referencing the time I want to invest with the modules/timelines of the courses and return the plan"""

# Example 2: Flight Search
# instruction = """Use flights.google.com to find the lowest fare from all eligible one-way flights for 1 adult from JFK to Heathrow in the next 30 days."""

# Example 3: Solar Eclipse Research
instruction = """Search for the next visible solar eclipse in North America and its expected date, and what about the one after that."""

# Example 4: GitHub PR Verification
# instruction = """Find the most recently opened non-draft PR on Github for Browserbase's Stagehand project and make sure the combination-evals in the PR validation passed."""
